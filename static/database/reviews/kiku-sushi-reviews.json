{"reviews": ["Stopped by Kiku Sushi after an Orioles game. Of course, we had to get the Orioles roll! It was HUGE and filled with crab flavor. We also got the Alaska Roll which was full of fresh flavor. In addition, we tried a poke bowl. It wasn't our favorite (even though the fish was fresh). I would stick with the sushi and miso soup. The restaurant is small and nothing fancy, but the service was friendly and fast.", "One of the best sushi spots in Baltimore! They always throw in a couple extra pieces with our order, sushi is always fresh and delicious! Staff works hard and is friendly! Restaurant itself is on the smaller side but clean and cozy. I frequent ordering to go though and quality is the same whether I dine in or out!", "We randomly stopped in here for a late lunch and it hit the spot for my sushi craving. I ordered a tuna roll that had seaweed salad on top. I love seaweed salad :) The beef dish my friend got was also good. Our fried gyoza appetizer was tasty as well. Overall, you will leave satisfied!", "I came here because the reviews were really good.  I went at lunch on a weekday and it was busy.  Every table full.  One guy working.  He was friendly but busy with take out orders, tables, and also making the sushi rolls.  Stretched too thin.  But never showed the stress.  My reasoning for not giving more stars is the fish didn't taste fresh.  I have no problem with the cost.  I've paid a lot of money on sushi and sashimi at other restaurants.  I've also paid not so much on the same food and received fresh ingredients.The eel in my roll was all skin and fat.  Not much meat. The nigiri were perfectly made.  I couldn't eat many of them because they put mango on top (which isn't listed on the menu and I'm allergic). The fish didn't seem right.  There wasn't a bad smell but if you know sushi and fish in general than you know!", "Sushi is amazing and good price but only if you have lots of time. Service is slow service since it's only one person making sushi at a time. Worth waiting for if you have time. Note the apps always say 30 min but it always takes much longer .", "Great nigiri options! The fish tasted extremely fresh and nice large pieces of nigiri. I also ordered the salmon roll which was awesome. Large chunks of fresh salmon in the roll. Great sushi spot and underrated for sure.", "A few friends and I wanted sushi so we headed over for an early dinner on a late Saturday afternoon. Parking was relatively easy since we arrived around 4:30 before Fed Hill got crowded. It's a small restaurant with about 5-6 tables and about 5 seats along a narrow food bar. We grabbed a table and were excited that there was only one other table occupied. We quickly learned that didn't mean anything about time since there were only 2 employees working. While it was a little slow, the food was delicious and the sake made us forget how long we'd been there. The Marcus Roll was delicious and everyone else enjoyed their food too.Clearly everyone knows about and loves this place because it was full by the time we left. Now that I've experienced it, I know to go with patience because it'll be worth the wait.", "After 7 years in the neighborhood, I don't know why it took me so long to try Kiku! Actually, I do know why, it is a little pricy. I tend to get simple roles. As a result, it can be hard for me to stomach a place that charges more than $5/6 per roll.All that aside, we but the bullet and order just 3 rolls. Total bill came to almost $30 for 3 very basic rolls, so I was anxious, but I should not have been. The food was amazing and the portions were great!!! In addition to the rolls, they threw in a couple pieces of sushi as well!Will definitely be back.", "Excellent service, delicious sushi (amazing sashimi to rice ratio) and reasonable pricing. Staff was very attentive and kind; really enjoyed our experience here!", "Let's start off by saying yes they have a 15% increased cost due to inflation. However, the quality and portion sizes definitely offset the price increase and I think this is still the best value for quality sushi in Baltimore city. In addition, they have a partially self serve model where you order at the counter and grab drinks on the side and they bring sushi and plates to the table. This is not the place if you are looking for a fine dining sushi experience but for a good value locally owned sushi shop I definitely recommend!For 2 people who split a Sapporo and 3 specialty rolls and 2 smaller rolls the total came out to about $80 plus tax and tip. Overall pricy but we did have some leftovers so probably over ordered.", "Stopped by Kiku Sushi after an Orioles game. Of course, we had to get the Orioles roll!
