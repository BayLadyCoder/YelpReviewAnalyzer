{"reviews": ["Needed something to warm me up and a cup of hot tea sounded delish when my friend and I stumbled upon this restaurant. We didn't make reservations but we were still seated immediately. It's cozy and warm inside too! They offer a large and diverse menu and I really wanted to try everything! Needing to warm up, I ordered the drunken noodles and they were delish! I wish they offered tea pots instead of just a cup, but the tea was yummy as well.", "Decided to check this place out on Newbury street for dinner! We were surprisingly pleased, would come back here again for sure.The service was great, the lady that was our server was extremely kind and friendly!Fried hot dog: this sounded interesting so we ordered this dish. Nothing crazy special but it did taste good! They're basically fried sausages with chili dip sauce. Chicken basil fried rice: probably wouldn't get again. The rice was a little mushy and the flavor was nothing special or amazing. Crispy Pork Basil: AMAZING!!! tasted sooo good. We really enjoyed this dish a lot. Would definitely get again, crispy and flavorful dish. You can adjust spiciness as you like!", "Casual dinner spot on newbury st. I didn't have high expectations coming into this place. I assume if a place has a neon sign advertising sushi that I won't enjoy the sushi. There is nothing wrong with the food here, but there's also nothing I found special. I ordered one of the thai curries, it was ok, not much depth of flavor and no real spice (I requested spicy). We had a few appetizers, but again nothing had much flavor and relied on dipping sauces to bring anything to the dishes.the service is friendly and prompt. I would avoid tables near the entrance (in winter), when someone comes in there is a huge draft that immediately comes in and it gets annoying. Thankfully I was able to move shortly after we arrived.", "One of my go to restaurants on Newbury St. I enjoy their tom yum soup and I typically order the drunken noodle. I also tried their chicken noodle soup, too. I am a fan of this spot. It is cozy and the service is great. I recommend!", "Incredible food and even better vibes. Perfect spot for a fun warm lunch. I loved it here. Good service. Sushi wasn't the best but the cyu was great and so was the chicken wings.", "I didn't really expect much when I first walked into this place because of the sign and how small it was, but honestly the taste of the dishes were pretty solid! I was only disappointed because of the quantity of the food compared to its price. It was way too pricey for the quantity of food given (felt like a snack) even thought the food itself was tasty. We paid $80 for pad thai, few sashimi slices, and a bento. The service was also just a little inefficient because the waiter forgot our dish and we were waiting a bit on it (it wasn't that busy too). If you're looking for a more expensive date night for simple food, this would be a good place to go because the vibes in there is pretty nice in the evening! I wouldn't come back though.", "Incredible food, wonderful atmosphere and the service is excellent. Highly recommend trying the rangoon, the sashimi bento box and the fried tofu. I can't say enough good things about how incredible the Brussels Sprouts are... omg.", "The Khao Soi and Pad Thai were amazing! Hands down one of the best pad thais we ever had. I just wished the chicken on the pad thai was more crispy but it's okay! Still very good. The khao soi broth was creamy and flavorful.", "Great spot for Thai food!It's a small hole in the wall on Newbury St, but they offer both indoor and outdoor seating. Service is super attentive and kind, and the interior is cozy and cute. We ordered the berry crab rangoon, tom yum noodle soup, and massaman curry. All were DELICIOUS and super flavorful. The crab rangoon were a nice change of pace. The berry sauce made it a nice sweet and salty treat. It was also a good ratio of crunch to filling and the salad that came with it was a delicious nutty and fresh complement.The tom yum noodle soup is probably one of the best I've had in Boston so far. The taste of the soup base is really authentic and all of the toppings round out the dish.The massaman curry was the only dish that I was a bit disappointed by. Flavors were good, but it was a bit sweet for me. The soft shell crab was also a bit greasy so I'd stay away from that going forward.Overall, their food is super tasty. The prices are on par with other Newbury St restaurants (a bit on the pricey side), but you will definitely have a good meal.", "Visited Bangkok Bento on a Tuesday evening. I was seated immediately although it was pretty busy inside the restaurant. The restaurant itself is not specifically beautiful as it has more of a hole in the wall aesthetic however it does have a cute little patio with outdoor seating that is nice. The menu is expansive as it includes Thai and Japanese dishes with options to cure any craving. I ordered the Raspberry Crab Rangoon and Miso soup to start. The miso soup was warm and had a good amount of tofu inside great as a starter. The real star however was the crab Rangoon. I'll admit I was nervous because of the raspberry but it was sooo good! The raspberry added a pleasant sweetness that kept me going back. Next I ordered the Tom Kha Gai which was also delicious - perfectly balanced a little spicy, savory and sweet. Would order again and again. As far as sushi I ordered the Sea of Love roll and the crunchy roll. Because it was pretty busy my rolls took a while to come out. The server/manager came to give updates often and she apologized profusely. She comped a few drinks - the Thai iced tea and the Thai Pink Milk. I am not a fan of Thai Tea but my friend did enjoy it. The Pink milk was tasty - taste similar to strawberry milk. the Sea of Love roll was delicious, if you like tuna this is the roll for you! The Crunchy roll was tasty - if you like deep fried rolls you will love this. Overall I would definitely  add this as a comfort food favorite. Perfect for a rainy or sick day.", "Needed something to warm me up and a cup of hot tea sounded delish when my friend and I stumbled upon this restaurant.
