{"reviews": ["We got the sushi, and the food was good, but if you are looking for more of a traditional sushi experience maybe check elsewhere? Most of their specialty rolls were more American fusion than traditional Japanese sushi, with a lot of 'krab' and spice-focused options, basically no specialty rolls focused on the fish. Our server was awesome, but the wait for our food was long enough that the server comped us a free dessert for our patience. The atmosphere was nice, though a little dark, so it was hard to read the menu. Overall it was a good date night, but if you are looking for a more traditional sushi experience I would recommend you check the menu first to see if it meets your expectations.", "After taking a few minutes to find parking, we went in and got seated quickly. The waitress took our drink order quickly, the service was very good. The prices are a little higher here than other places serving sushi. The sushi was enjoyable. We ordered the teriyaki chicken and shrimp. The shrimp was dry and hard, I've never had shrimp like that before. Difficult to chew. The chicken was sliced down and very dry as well. There was a very small portion of vegetables. For the price, the serving size was small. The protein was so dry we had to soak it in teriyaki to make it easier to chew. I would not order any food from the teriyaki menu again, just too dry and the serving size is small. You need to pay an additional $9 for fried rice, which we don't do this visit. The cocktail I ordered was $15 and very little alcohol was in it. This is a beautiful restaurant and I loved the location. Next time we definitely need to try other things on the menu", "I definitely recommend coming here for their lunch specials. Truly bang for your buck options. We got the bento boxes (mine with salmon and his teriyaki chicken). I got the California roll bento box which came with the salmon, salad, soup, rice, and vegetable tempura which I believe was around $15-16? What a great deal! Everything was pretty tasty, including the salmon. I tried my husband's Viva Las Vegas roll and it didn't impress me. Teriyaki chicken wasn't good. But as far as what I got, I liked.It was pretty empty for a Tuesday early afternoon, and our server did okay, he was nice, but could've been better and more attentive. The restaurant could be cleaner too.Overall, 3.5 stars in my book. I would come back for their lunch specials again.", "I've come here for sushi to go and also the late night happy hour (one of the best deals in the city!) The service is a little slower for the to go sushi but the taste is great. The pineapple wontons are life changing!!! I also recommend keeping the garlic edamame sauce to dip your sushi in! I love the classier ambiance for a good price. Love living so close to this great spot!", "Happy Hour post! Good sushi, but smaller portions than I'm used to. Drinks are good too. It's a little dark inside for me, but the metro vibe is definitely RA sushi. The service was slightly slow for a Friday afternoon, but our waiter did his best.", "This is a beautiful restaurant with great vibes. This night the hostess let us know they were short staffed so we went to the bar. The bartender had only been there for 5 days and seemed to struggle with doing drinks and serving the bar area. His coworkers were extremely helpful but he just seemed overwhelmed and kept having conversations that should not have been in front of the customers. Back to the food! The food was great and came out very fast. There was another young lady who came to help the bartender and she was amazing .", "I've been here several times. Parking: there is street parking but it's a hit and miss about the ability to find a spot. There is also a garage.Customer service-I'd give a 6 for if that was an option. It is always excellent service. And my most recent trip there in 9/29 was just as exceptional. Our server and the other staff there were just so friendly, engaging, and helpful without being overwhelming. They set the mood for the spot.Good: Spicy garlic edamame: this is so flavorful and I could drink the sauce. I am obsessed with it. I get this every time and highly recommend. It is not spicy at all but has a lot of flavor. It is salt and a bit tart. The flavors just mix well together.Spicy shrimp tempura roll: they were ok. The are a hit and miss. For some reason this last time they didn't taste that fresh. Seaweed salads: it looked delicious. It wasn't my jam, but my friend that eats them really enjoyed it.Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e: I was given this for my birthday and it was so delicious. Absolutely perfectly flavored. It is not a lot but I never think there is enough creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.Drinks: we tried the lychee and it was good but could have used a stronger lychee flavor. The white sangria was absolutely fruity, peachy, and delicious.", "The service was good and friendly. The spicy tuna roll was salty and pricey for what it was. I wouldn't recommend this dish. I probably would try other places as it wasn't what I was looking for.", "RA has seriously been my ride or die. I used to come here all the time for happy hours, late night happy hours, take-out sushi, etc. This particular Sunday, I was craving sushi so after looking up many options we decided to go back to this fan favorite. They have happy hour from 3-close on Sunday's, so we decided to sit at the bar. We both weren't feeling drinks because of the night before, but just in case. The bar area smelled funky to my friend. Kind of like dirty rags. We decided to move to a table, near the window. I've never sat near the window at RA!Good thing because we were waiting and waiting and waiting to be served. I was parched and just wanted a glass of water! No servers to be coming to our table. We saw another family get sit down and they not only got their waters, but also their drink orders.After about 20 minutes, I tried to call a server over for some water at least, if not our order. At that moment, we were ready to order as well. We ordered our food. I ordered-Vegetable tempura roll 3/5 - I don't know what changed from a couple of years ago to now, but this does not hit the same. I didn't finish it and gave the rest to my friend for leftoversPhiladelphia roll with avocado and cucumbers 3/5 - I definitely shouldn't had included avocado and just did cucumbers. It was a mushy gushy texture in my mouth.Because of the wait, they gave us 2 plates of shrimp sushi. I wasn't going to mention that I'm vegetarian, but my friend did. They gave me 1 cucumber roll, on the house.Regardless of the tardiness and terrible service, I still think it would've been better to just chop a menu item from the check. By the time the food we ordered came, we were full!", "I've come here multiple times and there's obviously a reason why - vegetarian tempura rolls! The first time I came here was in college with my roommate. Interesting experience. We sat at the sushi bar, which I despise. Later on, I would come for the late night happy hour. This place is perfect for that! I love love love that RA has a late night happy hour because I always end up here after dinner. The bar area is always packed so sometimes waiting for a table takes time, but if the party isn't too big it's not that much long of a wait. I've had the Umangi punch, and it's definitely something you want to share with that special someone. I've taken so many people here and they enjoy it as well. Regardless of food and happy hour deals, the indoor decor is just as cute with the lighting and the big paintings on the wall. As well as the location, right by the water. Parking may be a little difficult to find, but there is valet if needed.", "My recent visit here left me thoroughly impressed, largely due to the exceptional service provided by our waiter Marvin. His friendly demeanor and attentiveness truly enhanced the dining experience, and his thoughtful gesture of capturing a special moment for us added a personal touch that we greatly appreciated. We will definitely come back to see Marvin. As for the food, the quality surpassed even our high expectations. The Viva Las Vegas Rolls, Shrimp Tempura, Ra Ra Shrimp, and the flavorful Sake Sangria Red Port and Japanese Mule were all expertly prepared, showcasing the chef's commitment to both taste and presentation. The ambiance of the restaurant, with its dim lighting and elegant red ball lights hanging from the ceiling, created a warm and inviting atmosphere that added to the overall experience. This memorable visit has undoubtedly made this restaurant a top contender for future sushi cravings. I am already looking forward to my next visit to indulge in their delectable offerings once again", "We got the sushi, and the food was good, but if you are looking for more of a traditional sushi experience maybe check elsewhere?
