{"reviews": ["I loved this place. Came here on a Friday night after work with friends for dinner (group of 3). We were able to get seated within 20-30 mins, and just walked around the area and went to H-mart in the meantime. We sat at the bar, which was really nice. The space is space but didn't feel crowded or loud. Sitting at the bar, the service was so fast over the counter. The food was great. The menu had 3 tiers: classic, signature, specials. The prices ranged from around $7-17 for the tiers. We tried from each level and loved everything we had. The salmon cup appetizer was nice and flavorful, really loved the crispy phyllo cup with the salmon. The hand rolls were all great, and loved how crispy the nori was with the warmer rice. The fish was all fresh and so good. The standout for the night was the miso butter cod. The group loved it so much that we ordered seconds for everyone. It was sweet, savory, rich. Just delicious. They were good portions as well. Definitely recommend for anyone who was thinking of trying!", "I was really excited to visit this place after trying it in NY! The Boston location is pretty small but charming. I went on a weekday at 6:30 pm and was able to get seatings right away but there was a surge after 7!While the interior boasted beautiful decor, I yearned for dimmer lighting to enhance the fine dining ambiance. The brightness and escalating music, especially with the growing crowd, detracted from the experience.The youthful servers, seemingly in training, tended to our needs. The food, though good, fell short of my high expectations. Notable mentions include the 72hr aged cod roll, silky steamed eggs with ikura gel, lobster roll, and a delightful off-menu seafood miso soup, discovered through another waiter. The oversight of my server not mentioning it left me perplexed, but the soup's warmth and richness, abundant with clams and shrimp, concluded the meal on a positive note.I got 13 items in total to share between 2 people. 4 of the items were appetizers and 9 rolls. I would say to get full, you would need to spend around $90 per person with tip and tax and this is coming from someone who doesn't eat a lot.", "Overall: 3-3.5 starsThis is an updated review now that Matsunori is fully open. During the soft opening, it was a cute, understated sushi place with delicious simple hand rolls. Unfortunately, it's become an untzy sushi bar with somewhat inconsistent service and food. Ambience: 3 starsThe first difference that stood out was the ambience - they were playing really loud euro clubby music (untz untz untz throughout the meal...) which really clashed with the otherwise nice calm decor and the casually dressed diners and staff. Service: 2 starsOur waiter was really nice, but several of our orders were mistaken or forgotten. It wasn't a huge deal because it gave us a chance to change our order, but still... also the menu used to be short and simple, printed on a small card. Now it's a QR code to a website with multiple tabs that don't seem to serve much purpose other than justifying different pricing for the categories of hand rolls. Food: 4 stars (-1 for gross sweet potato roll)The hand rolls are still some of the best sushi in Boston, but there was definitely a decrease in quality compared to the soft opening. My sushi came out in a somewhat bizarre order (salmon - botan ebi - scallop - miso black cod - ikura - salmon mango??) but was still delicious. However I made the mistake of adding on the sweet potato roll which was NOT good - think a giant slab of slightly undercooked sweet potato with a big pile of gooey sweet potato whip on top that fell off right as I bit in.  The other sushi was still delicious, but the proportions of things seemed slightly off (too much soy sauce, too much garnish, etc)Overall still a good place, and if I hadn't gone during the soft opening and was going now for the first time I'd be more impressed. But mostly I feel wistful for how it used to be!", "Delicious, cute, and reasonably priced for Boston!The fish was extremely fresh and everything was simply dressed and didn't overpower the fish (except the truffle on the uni which I thought was too strong). The best was surprisingly the black miso cod - I'm normally not a fan of black miso cod (kind of overdone and sometimes the sauce is too strong) and I usually don't get cooked fish sushi but this was amazing! Very buttery but still light. Everything else we got was also great esp the scallop (not too fishy) and salmon. The only minor thing I didn't like was that the fish was really cold. But otherwise everything was great - can't wait to come back!!", "Legit these handrolls were so good, especially the miso black cod which basically blew my mind. The fish was incredibly succulent and slightly sweet.. just look how it glistens.. Also enjoyed the KBBQ A5 wagyu and blue crab but not as impressive. Decent size rolls with yummy sushi rice. The wagyu one is smaller (and more expensive) than the others. Small place and no reservations so be prepared for a wait. Quick service once you get a seat.", "I got to try Matsunori last night and was so excited. It was a short wait and I got sat at the bar since it was available first but I probably should have asked for a table since it was a little bit crowded.I got the mango shrimp tempura, snow crab, spicy scallop, miso cod, scallop, and tried my friend's eel with fois gras. All were fresh and really good but my all time favorites have to be the spicy scallop and the miso cod. Scallops were so fresh and soft with no fishiness and the miso cod was warm and flavorful.The regular scallop one was great but the lime zest was all in one bite so it was a bit too zesty but I like the idea to add lime zest to something more simple. My friend really liked the eel, miso cod, and truffle avocado, and the yellowtail one was good but nothing special. Service was quick and attentive and the hand rolls are served as prepared which wasn't an issue since everything came out quickly. I like how the appetizer/dessert menu is simple to highlight the rolls but I wish there was another dessert option like a matcha tiramisu or something. For the reviews saying you'd need to eat 8 of these, I would say 5 was more than enough for me and they were larger than I expected based off reviews (I would say each roll is like 2-3 pieces of maki). To sum it up, I will definitely be returning soon!", "We came here to try out the handrolls and honestly it was really good! The servers are very informative and friendly. Our server told us that each person usually orders around 4-5 handrolls since it was our first time so we did that and we were pretty stuffed. The edamame and cup bites were great, and the quality of the fish was really good! Yes, the prices are high but I think that it was a good experience for the quality of fish and dishes. I would come here again for a special night out! The place had a decent amount of seats at the bar and tables, but it is small so the wait gets long if you're not there as soon as it opens.", "Love the place, particularly for that nothing similar exists in the area!  They have a variety of rolls, and we like most of them.  Favorites include crab, cod, and uni.  The appetizer steamed egg and salmon cup are also great.One thing I don't like a lot is that they rush to take the tray used to hold the rolls away, like within seconds you take your roll, so you get interrupted frequently.Another thing is the place is small.  when the tables are separated to seat multiple 2 people parties, it's extremely hard to get in and out from the seats - might be cozier to sit at the bar instead if available.", "Yummy. First of all, I think the price per person is probably about $50-75. I see dating couples ordering more and more hand rolls. Three pieces, even when you're not that hungry, doesn't seem like enough for these hand rolls. Also, the fact that they're so tasty doesn't help.One question, out of annoyance, and also curiosity, is what are the chefs/servers rationales for separating orders of twos? They should go together so that parties ordering such can enjoy the same dish at the same time, no? That's not how they do it though. They just mixed it up, which defeats the purpose of telling you to eat the individual piece served right away -- while the seaweed and rice is still warm and the meat is cold, or vice versa. I'm curious about the rationale and encourage the owner -- who's been active on replying to reviews -- to comment. Thanks for reading!", "Came here for a private birthday event and the staff was amazing despite a busy two hours. They were very organized and it was all a perfect celebratory night! The food was delicious. We allllll could not stop talking about the miso cod. Must get. I will return just for this honestly! The blue crab was delicious and packed w crab! Uni was a great mixture taste. Mango salmon and kbbq wagyu were delicious also- I would probably try something new next time instead of getting these again. Overall we all enjoyed the food and the tastes. We got very full off 4-5 rolls and we all said we'd definitely come back! Highly recommend!", "I think this place is pretty overhyped for the food quality but it's good for what's available in Boston. They have a short menu of hand rolls averaging about $8 a roll. For a meal, it does add up by the end of the meal. It's a small restaurant so not great for a large group to dine there. From our table, I heard the eel was the best of the hand rolls they ordered. I don't have any distinct memory of each roll as they tasted just fine. There's def some lesser known places that have blown me away.", "I loved this place.
