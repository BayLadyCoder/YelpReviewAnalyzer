{"reviews": ["This is probably the best sushi spot taste wise in the Baltimore Area. The food is great, but I have a few minor issues that sometimes could steer me away from this restaurant that all don't apply to the food. First of all, this has nothing to do with the service and staff, every time that I have been they were excellent. Friendly, nice, informant and efficient, absolutely zero complaint there.My issue is the ambiance. Normally this problem is not applicable if the food was at a more affordable price, but since I am paying a premium, my expectations for better ambiance raise slightly. Personally I found the music too loud, making it harder to listen to anyone that you're dining with. Also the latest time I dined at Azumi, the temperature was a tad cold, but this issue is practically negligible because you're eating sushi or sashimi, a typically colder food. Slight tip before I do nothing but compliment the food: Any and everything on the menu with the words \"Wagyu\" on it is obscenely overpriced and overrated. But the food is overall enough to cancel out those problems. The nigiri sushi is always molded very well, with the pieces being a perfect one biter size and the fish stays very nicely and firmly intact with the rice. I like their nigiri plate because it showcases some of the best pieces they have in house at that moment. I'd also like to note that the soy sauce is a nice quality and the wasabi is pretty close to real fresh grated wasabi and sometimes they do have fresh grated wasabi. The sashimi is also great, nice variety textures and flavors from the fish and a mostly decent portion for the price. The Desserts here have recently become something worth staying and ordering. I had a panna cotta here last time and it was excellent with a nice sauce and crumble on top for amazing contrast. Some other dishes I would recommend that I know my family really enjoys would be the Crispy Fried Calamari and Rock Shrimp Tempura for appetizers. And Entrees I would recommend would be the Miso Black Cod & Chirashi bowl.Overall, I would recommend going here for a party vibe with amazing food, not a calmer dinner to be enjoyed in a more intimate setting.", "I have been going to Azumi for many years and it has always been good. However, I went last night and was very disappointed. The same cocktail I always order has been changed. They used to make it with regular ice but now they use a giant ice ball that takes up the entire glass. When you take the ice ball out there was literally a drop of liquid in the glass. It costs $20. As the photos show I have been there on many occasions when it has been made properly. The manager then proceeds to come over to the table when I sent it back and ask what we are concerned about and argues with us telling us he's been there over a year and we are wrong. Very rude and very disappointed with Azumi overall last night. He walked away and did nothing.", "Went for a dinner meeting- pretty private room-servers very attentive and knowledgeable Amazing trufffle tuna tartar, sashimi and sushi very fresh and miso cod just perfect.  Lobster fried rice a little heavy-handed with salt but was a huge hit with my groupCan't wait to have another dinner here!", "What's the most important thing at a sushi restaurant? The sushi! Everything at Azumi was incredible, but the sushi was out of this world. It was presented beautifully, prepared well, and made from really stellar ingredients. It delivered everything I had hoped for from a quality sushi restaurant. The other aspects of my visit were great too. The service was outstanding, and everyone was very friendly. We never had to wait for anything. The restaurant is dark and loud, which might not be for everyone, but it was a cool atmosphere. I had a great time here!", "This place is pretty gorgeous. I highly recommend sitting outside to look at the Baltimore harbor. It's so lovely. Hubs and I decided to get the tasting menu. I think maybe we got really full quickly because we had some drinks that afternoon, but you definitely won't leave hungry after this meal! I enjoyed a lot of it. I think the standouts for me what the fried rice and the carpaccio. What I would say was just mediocre was the actual sushi rolls and the nigiri that was served.  The service was great - the waiter was super nice. I really enjoyed the food and scenery - this spot is a definite recommend if you're in the area.", "Azumi falls right in line with the other Atlas Restaurant Group offerings. Great location on the water, contemporary, excellent service and amazing food.It was a nice evening so we chose to kick it outside to enjoy the weather. The Saki was strong and delicious...Best I've ever had! The music emanated throughout the entire patio, truly making it a cool azz vibe!Let's talk about the food. We had the Black Miso Cod, Flaming King Crab roll, Tiger Prawns and the Lamb appetizer. Everything was GREAT, however, I deducted a star because of value. The Flaming King Crab roll will cost you a whopping $36 and the lamb app another $16 per chop.. that's one lonely Lamb Chop...LOL!Azumi is connected to the Four Season's Hotel, which is great because my favorite B'more lounge is just a few steps and an elevator ride away.This was my first time at Azumi but definitely not my last. An absolute delightful experience!", "It is a nice restaurant and the location is convenient. There's valet parking but there's also a parking garage up the block. Being in Baltimore, you have a mix of people there. They have a little lounge area to wait in while they set your table. We were able to get our drinks started there. It was taking a little while to be seated, but expected since it was a Friday night. The food was good and came out fast. We got calamari and edamame. I got a Tekka roll which is just a tuna roll, super fresh. My girlfriend loved her shrimp tempura roll. The fried rice was good, but I took some points off because the wagyu was barely noticeable. It was cut down so small. I would come here again, but probably not on such a busy night. It's also nice because you can eat and then go for a walk around the harbor. Come here for a date night or a girl's night out!", "We were a party of 30 for a celebratory dinner with a reservation time at 7 pm and was seated promptly with no wait. Thank goodness everyone was on time, because this could have gone left real quick...LolAzumi is an interesting place - definitely an upscale, elevated feel attached to the Four Seasons in Baltimore. The pricing and level of service reflect the upscale nature, excellent service, creative cocktails, and elevated take on dishes. Located on the picturesque Inner Harbor, Azumi features panoramic waterfront views of the city's downtown district.The dishes were all spectacularly plated with appropriate proportions. It all balanced well between hot and cold, soft and chewy, light and rich, sweet and salty. This was the most wonderful dinner experience. Various staff members were attentive and informative about the dishes and always engaged with us politely. I would recommend it to anyone!", "Best restaurant in Baltimore for sushi. You are paying for the quality and freshness. The sushi is the star of the show here and highly recommend the otoro, chutoro, amber jack, yellowtail, and salmon. The A5 Wagyu Fried Rice is also a quiet star. The fattiness  from the wagyu is cut well with the starchy fried rice. The rice pudding is an excellent way to finish. With larger groups, expect to be here 2+ hours as service can be slow. Great ambiance overall.", "Azumi is literally one of my favorite places in Baltimore. The location is Harbor East right on the water, with indoor and outdoor seating plus an indoor and outdoor bar. They also have a really good and straight to the point happy hour. $6 margaritas and discounted hand sushi rolls.

Everything at Azumi was incredible, but the sushi was out of this world. It was presented beautifully, prepared well, and made from really stellar ingredients. It delivered everything I had hoped for from a quality sushi restaurant. The other aspects of my visit were great too. The service was outstanding, and everyone was very friendly. We never had to wait for anything. The restaurant is dark and loud, which might not be for everyone, but it was a cool atmosphere. I had a great time here!", "This place is pretty gorgeous. I highly recommend sitting outside to look at the Baltimore harbor. It's so lovely. Hubs and I decided to get the tasting menu. I think maybe we got really full quickly because we had some drinks that afternoon, but you definitely won't leave hungry after this meal! I enjoyed a lot of it. I think the standouts for me what the fried rice and the carpaccio. What I would say was just mediocre was the actual sushi rolls and the nigiri that was served.  The service was great - the waiter was super nice. I really enjoyed the food and scenery - this spot is a definite recommend if you're in the area.", "Azumi falls right in line with the other Atlas Restaurant Group offerings. Great location on the water, contemporary, excellent service and amazing food.It was a nice evening so we chose to kick it outside to enjoy the weather. The Saki was strong and delicious...Best I've ever had! The music emanated throughout the entire patio, truly making it a cool azz vibe!Let's talk about the food. We had the Black Miso Cod, Flaming King Crab roll, Tiger Prawns and the Lamb appetizer. Everything was GREAT, however, I deducted a star because of value. The Flaming King Crab roll will cost you a whopping $36 and the lamb app another $16 per chop.. that's one lonely Lamb Chop...LOL!Azumi is connected to the Four Season's Hotel, which is great because my favorite B'more lounge is just a few steps and an elevator ride away.This was my first time at Azumi but definitely not my last. An absolute delightful experience!", "It is a nice restaurant and the location is convenient. There's valet parking but there's also a parking garage up the block. Being in Baltimore, you have a mix of people there. They have a little lounge area to wait in while they set your table. We were able to get our drinks started there. It was taking a little while to be seated, but expected since it was a Friday night. The food was good and came out fast. We got calamari and edamame. I got a Tekka roll which is just a tuna roll, super fresh. My girlfriend loved her shrimp tempura roll. The fried rice was good, but I took some points off because the wagyu was barely noticeable. It was cut down so small. I would come here again, but probably not on such a busy night. It's also nice because you can eat and then go for a walk around the harbor. Come here for a date night or a girl's night out!", "We were a party of 30 for a celebratory dinner with a reservation time at 7 pm and was seated promptly with no wait. Thank goodness everyone was on time, because this could have gone left real quick...LolAzumi is an interesting place - definitely an upscale, elevated feel attached to the Four Seasons in Baltimore. The pricing and level of service reflect the upscale nature, excellent service, creative cocktails, and elevated take on dishes. Located on the picturesque Inner Harbor, Azumi features panoramic waterfront views of the city's downtown district.The dishes were all spectacularly plated with appropriate proportions. It all balanced well between hot and cold, soft and chewy, light and rich, sweet and salty. This was the most wonderful dinner experience. Various staff members were attentive and informative about the dishes and always engaged with us politely. I would recommend it to anyone!", "Best restaurant in Baltimore for sushi. You are paying for the quality and freshness. The sushi is the star of the show here and highly recommend the otoro, chutoro, amber jack, yellowtail, and salmon. The A5 Wagyu Fried Rice is also a quiet star. The fattiness  from the wagyu is cut well with the starchy fried rice. The rice pudding is an excellent way to finish. With larger groups, expect to be here 2+ hours as service can be slow. Great ambiance overall.", "Azumi is literally one of my favorite places in Baltimore. The location is Harbor East right on the water, with indoor and outdoor seating plus an indoor and outdoor bar. They also have a really good and straight to the point happy hour. $6 margaritas and discounted hand sushi rolls. I've gone here for dinner and happy hour and I'm never disappointed with my food, service, or the overall ambiance of the restaurant. Now you are not going to get a ton of food for your money but the food you do get will not disappoibtvy", "This is probably the best sushi spot taste wise in the Baltimore Area. The food is great, but I have a few minor issues that sometimes could steer me away from this restaurant that all don't apply to the food. First of all, this has nothing to do with the service and staff, every time that I have been they were excellent. Friendly, nice, informant and efficient, absolutely zero complaint there.My issue is the ambiance. Normally this problem is not applicable if the food was at a more affordable price, but since I am paying a premium, my expectations for better ambiance raise slightly. Personally I found the music too loud, making it harder to listen to anyone that you're dining with. Also the latest time I dined at Azumi, the temperature was a tad cold, but this issue is practically negligible because you're eating sushi or sashimi, a typically colder food. Slight tip before I do nothing but compliment the food: Any and everything on the menu with the words \"Wagyu\" on it is obscenely overpriced and overrated. But the food is overall enough to cancel out those problems. The nigiri sushi is always molded very well, with the pieces being a perfect one biter size and the fish stays very nicely and firmly intact with the rice. I like their nigiri plate because it showcases some of the best pieces they have in house at that moment. I'd also like to note that the soy sauce is a nice quality and the wasabi is pretty close to real fresh grated wasabi and sometimes they do have fresh grated wasabi. The sashimi is also great, nice variety textures and flavors from the fish and a mostly decent portion for the price. The Desserts here have recently become something worth staying and ordering. I had a panna cotta here last time and it was excellent with a nice sauce and crumble on top for amazing contrast. Some other dishes I would recommend that I know my family really enjoys would be the Crispy Fried Calamari and Rock Shrimp Tempura for appetizers. And Entrees I would recommend would be the Miso Black Cod & Chirashi bowl.Overall, I would recommend going here for a party vibe with amazing food, not a calmer dinner to be enjoyed in a more intimate setting.", "I have been going to Azumi for many years and it has always been good. However, I went last night and was very disappointed. The same cocktail I always order has been changed. They used to make it with regular ice but now they use a giant ice ball that takes up the entire glass. When you take the ice ball out there was literally a drop of liquid in the glass. It costs $20. As the photos show I have been there on many occasions when it has been made properly. The manager then proceeds to come over to the table when I sent it back and ask what we are concerned about and argues with us telling us he's been there over a year and we are wrong.

Come here for a date night or a girl's night out!", "We were a party of 30 for a celebratory dinner with a reservation time at 7 pm and was seated promptly with no wait. Thank goodness everyone was on time, because this could have gone left real quick...LolAzumi is an interesting place - definitely an upscale, elevated feel attached to the Four Seasons in Baltimore. The pricing and level of service reflect the upscale nature, excellent service, creative cocktails, and elevated take on dishes. Located on the picturesque Inner Harbor, Azumi features panoramic waterfront views of the city's downtown district.The dishes were all spectacularly plated with appropriate proportions. It all balanced well between hot and cold, soft and chewy, light and rich, sweet and salty. This was the most wonderful dinner experience. Various staff members were attentive and informative about the dishes and always engaged with us politely. I would recommend it to anyone!", "Best restaurant in Baltimore for sushi. You are paying for the quality and freshness. The sushi is the star of the show here and highly recommend the otoro, chutoro, amber jack, yellowtail, and salmon. The A5 Wagyu Fried Rice is also a quiet star. The fattiness  from the wagyu is cut well with the starchy fried rice. The rice pudding is an excellent way to finish. With larger groups, expect to be here 2+ hours as service can be slow. Great ambiance overall.", "Azumi is literally one of my favorite places in Baltimore. The location is Harbor East right on the water, with indoor and outdoor seating plus an indoor and outdoor bar. They also have a really good and straight to the point happy hour. $6 margaritas and discounted hand sushi rolls. I've gone here for dinner and happy hour and I'm never disappointed with my food, service, or the overall ambiance of the restaurant. Now you are not going to get a ton of food for your money but the food you do get will not disappoibtvy"], "analyzedData": {"sentiment": 30.86, "popular": 80.0, "summary": "This restaurant got the best compliments", "img": "best.png"}}
