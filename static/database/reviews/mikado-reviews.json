{"reviews": ["One of the best Japanese restaurants I've ever tried. Ambiance inside is very nice with tasteful decorations. I always get the hand rolls but one waiter suggested we can convert them to maki rolls, so we did that to make it feel like our food lasts longer. They give a lot of fish in the rolls and it's high quality fish. Chicken teriyaki was also good, very flavorful and not dry. Takeout sushi is also still great quality", "Delivery review:Consistently a delicious and fresh meal. The crispy rice was definitely an order-again.", "Came here to celebrate and the entrees didn't disappoint! I tried the truffle mushroom bacon fried rice, signature buckwheat cold noodle and braised angus beef short ribs. Both the cold noodle and the short ribs were soo good. I was literally doing a happy dance while I was eating. For handballs I ordered spicy crab, scallop yuzu, spicy salmon and wagyu uni.  I don't recommend is the wagyu uni. I thought the waygu was over cooked and it was not worth the $22 compare to everything I ordered with my friends. The service was good. The staff members were friendly. I do want to go back again to try their other entrees.", "Take-out review: This restaurant is gorgeous. I love the decor, it's so pretty and elegant. I made the trek here despite the rain and have no regrets! The order was ready and beautifully packaged. I got the four maki roll set and each piece was filled to the brim. The fish was incredibly fresh and they are so generous with the fillings. My favorite in order is yellowtail scallion, salmon, tuna and the eel avocado. Even their wasabi was high quality! I loved the wasabi. I'll spurge for the toro and scallops next time. I loved the food and would love to come back to dine in and try something else on the menu.", "This is a review on delivery.Mikado is a new contender on the block. It focuses on quality over quantity versus the other everyday sushi fusion shops that focus on lunch specials and filling you up. Packing is top tier, you can taste the freshness and for those willing to pay a little bit more but don't need to the full experience, this is the spot for you.Taste: 5/5Service: N/A had deliveryAmbience: N/A had deliveryValue for money: 4/5We had:1) 4 set maki roll - High quality and probably an easy go to2) Crispy Rice - Deep fried rice, a bit gimmicky and it takes away from overall flavour but it's not bad3) Sushi taco - good crunch4) Truffle mushroom bacon rice - another highlight and recommended!All in all, this was a good refreshing spot versus your run of the mill sushi takeout restaurant. Would recommend giving it a try!", "*delivery only*Who doesn't crave sushi and also not want to venture out into the cold? I was looking around at sushi shops near me and saw the great reviews! I usually have a go-to spot but they don't have crispy rice and I was craving it so decided to give it a go. The delivery was actually faster than estimated which was amazing! The sushi comes in really sturdy cardboard boxes which not only makes the display of sushi nicer, but keeps it protected during transit. Now for the sushi itself, the crispy rice was absolutely delicious and still a bit warm!!! I got a 4combo maki and all of them were delicious especially the yellowtail jalape\u00f1o and spicy salmon. Definitely would order from here again but also would like to dine in too!", "Great addition to the neighborhood! Ordered their lunch combos multiple times and they never disappoint. The service is quick and the servers are friendly. Love the decor in the restaurant and how pretty it is inside. Would definitely recommended!", "The atmosphere was nice and clean! There's a bar as soon as you walk in and also more seating inside. We sat inside and were served promptly with some water. The service was great. The waiter gave us menus to look at and then left. After looking at their menu we decided to get the shrimp teriyaki and black cod fish bento. It comes with miso soup, spicy tuna appetizers and rice. Everything came out quickly and we loved the cod fish and the shrimp was also delicious. Our favorite was the spicy tuna with a crunchy chip underneath! Tasty and loved the different textures! We also ordered a chicken fried rice which was also yummy! Definitely recommend coming here for Japanese food! Especially the Bento!

I asked one of the servers about it and they said that they updated the menu. This was upsetting because we were looking forward to it and one of the main reason we chose the signature set over the premium set. The cold soba noodles which was topped with king crab, uni, ikura and sesame dressing was really good and my most favorite dish. The tuna tart was okay, it lacked flavor. The \"pickled\" cucumber was not pickled at all, the cucumbers were \"white\" and not yellow from any vinegar. The ponzu jelly on the madai just tasted like full sodium soy sauce, so it was overpowering. The oyster with yuzu foam was very fresh and buttery. I chose the toro scallion hand roll and the rice wasn't vinegary enough and we were told that they would bring soy sauce and wasabi so we can add some flavor but it took too long and the seaweed became soft so I just ate it without anything additional. My fianc\u00e9 got the scallop yuzu hand roll and it was really good. The fish in the 10 pieces of premium nigiris were really fresh but sliced very thin and the sushi rice again was not vinegary enough, it tasted like plain white rice. Overall, I don't think the experience was worth the price point. We ordered 2 signature sets, 2 beers and a cocktail and it was $240 total (tip included) for two people. Also for the price point, usually the restaurant uses freshly grated wasabi and not paste.", "I ordered sushi takeout from here and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste.
