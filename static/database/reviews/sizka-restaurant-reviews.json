{"reviews": ["The omakase dinner experience is well worth the $95 and is a great date night idea. The experience is done at the bar and is available for six people at a time. I believe reservations must be made ahead of time for the omakase dinner but the restaurant has many tables inside for dinner/lunch walk ins. The first course is a miso soup followed by 10 nigiri pieces, a six piece maki roll and a a single dessert  roll. The chef does a great job explaining the pieces of fish, cut, and location of origin. As mentioned in other reviews the restaurant is BYOB. The restaurant is also a bit more casual and not too fancy compared to other omakase style restaurants.", "I wanted to like it but there were just too many misses here. Fatty tuna was 5/5 delicious so get that if you decide to order here. Ribeye bulgogi was just OK and some of the other sushi the texture of the fish was extremely chewy - not sure what was going on. Still smelled fresh but I ended up not eating half my meal. Walking into this place you get a bit of mall feeling - I would choose takeout over dine in.", "The sushi restaurant was so good and very delicious. They have fresh food and everything was so tasty. They have great options too. I like the Bluefin Tuna Roll, and Omakase Selection. Wonderful flavor and great texture. Good quality of fish. Nice portion size of food. The restaurant was so cool and has pleasant atmosphere. Served food promptly.", "This was my first time at Sizka and I was pleasantly surprised by the food that was here. A friend had recommended this spot for a hangout and I said yes but was hesitant because of their prices, but I am really glad I gave this place a try. We went on a Thursday evening around 6:30pm and we were the only ones at the restaurant. We ordered a PinkPong Roll and a Maryland Roll. Both were quite tasty, but I did like the PinkPong Roll more and am excited to go back and order it again. The Maryland Roll was tasty, but I think that the fried soft-shell crab was something that I haven't had in a roll before and was a little too crunchy for me. I am usually not the type to order specialty style sushi roll (I'm more of a combination bento with sashimi type of person), but I thought that the rolls here were great and would definitely come back again. However, it may not be my first recommendation given the higher price point of this place in comparison to others like Nanami in Fells.", "Sizka is definitely Baltimore's best kept secret. The sushi here is AMAZING both in quality and taste. The ambiance of the place is very chill, me and my friend sat at their new sushi bar. If you pop in and there's no reservations at the bar, I'd definitely recommend sitting there to get a view of the chefs doing their thing! You really get a feel for the quality of their craftsmanship and the fish. We also went on a Friday night and it wasn't crowded.We ordered the sunset roll, the yellowtail scallion roll, and an eel roll. I can honestly say I never knew sushi could be so high quality! The sunset roll was my fave, it was smokey and spicy but in a very palatable way. They also gave us a free cup of miso soup with our order which was such a nice touch. The yellowtail in the roll was mad with heaps of fish and not some kind of sushi mush lol. Overall, this has been one of my favorite finds this year.", "3 stars for ambiance & service, but 4 stars for food quality for value! We tried Sizka's omakase menu and it was such a steal for $80. Please keep in mind this review is compared to other omakase places that are typically ($100+ pp). We got a variety of fish as part of the omakase menu which included blue fin tuna, sweet shrimp, o-toro and toro handroll. I would not say it was the best sushi / omakase I've ever had, but for $80 - the selection & quality was VERY nice. We went for a special occasion but tbh the ambiance is more of a local neighborhood sushi place rather than a fancy omakase place. Maybe that's how they keep their prices low! You don't need to dress up or anything as folks typically were wearing casual clothes. One final note is they have specific times for omakase dining (you get to dine at the sushi bar) but if you're like us and eat pretty slow, you may be asked to move to a standard table after ~ 2 hours so they can accommodate the next round of folks who signed up for the experience (which is totally reasonable). If we want decent sushi for a reasonable price, we'll definitely be coming back to Sizka! Maybe we'll order a la carte vs. omakase next time since we know which sushi we like :)", "Wow! This place is legit. I was in the Canton neighborhood with a few friends and we stopped into Sizka on a whim. My friend swore that this was THE best sushi in the city. The inside is quiet, low key, with a dining area and a sushi bar. It was a pretty quiet afternoon with only one other couple dining in so we asked if the four of us could sit at the sushi bar. The server said normally that they reserve the bar for omakase service but we could sit there anyways. That's how I knew this spot was about to be good and very authentic. OH, also it's BYOB so take that as you will. We placed our order and I asked for some gluten free soy sauce. To my surprise, they had some! The server then brought out some miso soup for my friends and let me know she didn't bring me any since it is not gluten free. I really appreciated her keeping that top of mind so that I didn't have to look up ingredients on the fly (I actually didn't realize miso soup wasn't gluten free). The miso soup was included in the meal - maybe this is just something they do at lunch?We each got an assortment of things. I got a spicy salmon roll and an avocado roll. Both were delish and super fresh. They went well with the gluten free tamari sauce too! My friends' food also looked amazing, especially the specialty rolls!I definitely would like to go back when I'm more hungry so I can explore more of the menu. I was really impressed and would recommend this spot to anyone!", "Nice low key sushi spot in Baltimore city. I will definitely come back to fulfill those cravings and try out the omakase.It was fairly quiet for a Friday night and there wasn't a wait. They are BYOB and have non alcoholic drinks available. Their waiters were really attentive and you had the choice of sitting at the counter or a table.We ordered a few rolls and the vegetable yakisoba to share. They give you a miso soup with your entree which was really nice. Their portion sizes are pretty reasonable and I would recommend 2 rolls per person. We really enjoyed the Sizka and Firecracker rolls, they make their own Hot Cheetos like topping which was delicious. Prices averaged $6-9 for regular rolls and $15-18 for specialty rolls but they are generous with the fish portion and everything tasted pretty fresh.", "Customer service was very on point throughout my visit. That being said, the restaurant was completely empty when I went... but I've been inside empty restaurants and have gotten pretty poor customer service... so... it's definitely not a given. I ordered the edamame which was REALLY good. It almost tasted like the salt that was put on the edamame was mixed with something. Or it was like a special salt. It really made the veg light up. And the edamame were cooked perfectly. Which was funny cause basically (it felt like) 45 seconds after I ordered it, it was on my table lol. I also ordered the chicken yakitori appetizer. Perfectly cooked chicken in a nice sweet balanced sauce. Can't go wrong here. The only thing I didn't love was the California rolls (of which I ordered three orders). Now... I know you're like... what newb orders California rolls at a nice sushi place... but I'm sorry! They're my favorite! Sue me. Actually, please don't sue me. That would be miserable. In any event, I can't put my finger on it, but some of the seasoning in the roll... or maybe just the kani they use. I don't know... but something was just a little bit not to my taste. It's all good, definitely wouldn't prevent me from going there and again. Everything was super fresh, the service was great, the selection was good. I will say though, the California rolls were 8 bucks a piece... which I feel like is a bit pricey for a California roll... but sushi-flation is a thing. Actually, just inflation which affects everything. I've been cooking A LOT at home recently, so maybe I just haven't noticed it as much. Overall a lovely meal. I'd probably just do sashimi or their special rolls next time.", "A wonderful sushi spot right in Canton square. Sizka houses a gorgeous, lengthy sushi bar where one can enjoy Omakase at $80 per person. There are also dining tables to sit comfortably and order a la carte sushi and anything else from the menu.This place has been on our must-try for a while but we were waiting to enjoy the Omakase experience in person. I think of it like dinner theater, you have a front row seat to watch the sushi chef meticulously cut, create and serve the special selections to you. Sizka's quality of fish and the presentation was top tier. While the Omakase includes a lot of food - 12 pieces of nigiri with a toro maki and a miso soup to start - we did order a few things in addition to try. The takoyaki appetizer was delicious although the fish flakes weren't dancing like I'm used to. The seaweed salad was also a hit. Admittedly we didn't need the extra items because the Omakase meal was so much food but I'm glad we tried so many things.
