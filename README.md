# About
The Yelp Review Analyzer is designed for individuals who are tired of reading hundreds of Yelp reviews but want to quickly understand what people are saying about restaurants or determine if the majority of reviews lean more towards negative or positive sentiments.

This application can solve your problems. It features a visual chart that shows the 30 most mentioned words in all reviews, provides overall sentiment analysis, and tracks popularity. Moreover, it also translates the reviews for you from English to Spanish, Thai, or Chinese. I hope you enjoy using this application.
